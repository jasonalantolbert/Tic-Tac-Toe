# Tic-Tac-Toe

Play a game of tic-tac-toe with a friend. Windows users can try it out by downloading ``tictactoe.exe`` [here](https://github.com/jasonalantolbert/Tic-Tac-Toe/releases) (no Python installation required). macOS and Linux users will have to run the Python source code directly, which really is not that much more difficult, and for Windows users may even be preferable to running the executable because your antivirus may not play nice with it.

Written and tested in Python 3.6. Download Python: https://python.org/downloads
